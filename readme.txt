Seamlessly adds 3 new menu locations to the admin toolbar and removes the WP logo menu.

== Description ==

Add 3 new menu locations to the WordPress toolbar so you can quickly and easily create your own custom toolbar menus using the built in WordPress menus page.<br />
Supports multi level and works seamlessly with the existing toolbar.<br /><br />
First menu location is under the 'Site Name' menu dropdown on the left side.<br />
Second menu location is along the main toolbar.<br />
Third menu location is under the 'Howdy / My Account' dropdown.<br /><br />
Also removes the WP Logo menu from the top left of the toolbar.<br /><br />
Super simple to use, just like building any other menu in WordPress using the menus page.<br />
No settings, just 'plug and play'.

Some of the features included:

*   Simple toolbar menu customization using WordPress menus
*   Removes WP logo menu from the top left of the admin toolbar
*   Seamless integration with the existing WordPress menus
*   No Settings, just 'plug and play'

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this display menus to admin only or everyone? =

The menus created will be visible to anyone logged in.

= Can you make it show only to admins? =

You could quite easily but you would need to know a little php. You simply need to add a conditional statement to the plugin to make sure only the admin user role can see the menus.

= Do you have to use all 3 menus? =

Nope! If you don't assign a menu to the locations, they simply won't show up.

== Screenshots ==

1. 3 new toolbar menu locations added to your existing locations.
2. You can see the new locations below when creating your menus.
3. Example main toolbar menu with multi level flyout.

== Additional Info ==
**Idea Behind / Philosophy:** This is something that I have found super useful when it comes to customizing WordPress for a client. I have been writing custom menus for quite a while and realised there is not much out there like this. No more code snippets, copy pasting or including files, simply install the plugin and away you go using the built in WordPress menus. A simple but powerful plugin to give you more customization powers over the admin toolbar.

== Future Features ==
* More power over menu locations with options to pick which locations you want to use and the menu order in relation to existing WordPress menus.
* Options page to remove other standard toolbar menu items. *(you can uncomment these in the code now if you're keen ;)*
Again, feel free to [shoot me suggestions](mailto:wp@benbodhi.com)
